    "# Novel-taxa and simulated community generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the generation of reference databases for both novel-taxa and simulated community analyses. Novel-taxa analysis is a form of cross-validated taxonomic classification, wherein random unique sequences are sampled from the reference database as a test set; all sequences sharing taxonomic affiliation at a given taxonomic level are removed from the reference database (training set); and taxonomy is assigned to the query sequences at the given taxonomic level. Thus, this test interrogates the behavior of a taxonomy classifier when challenged with \"novel\" sequences that are not represented by close matches within the reference sequence database. Such an analysis is performed to assess the degree to which \"overassignment\" occurs for sequences that are not represented in a reference database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated community analysis represents more conventional cross-validated classification, wherein unique sequences are randomly sampled from a reference dataset and used as a test set for taxonomic classification, using a training set that has those sequences removed, but not other sequences that share taxonomic affiliation. Instead, the training set must contain identical taxonomies to those represented by the test sequences."
